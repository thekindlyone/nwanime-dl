###Note: Currently works only for linux and mac as it uses wget for the final download.

###Edit: It works with windows too, provided the steps mentioned below under "Windows Specific Instructions" are followed.

###Installation:
git clone this repo. then run       
```python setup.py install```          
or               
```pip install nwanime-dl```

###Windows Specific Instructions:        
1. You will need to add ```c:\python27\Scripts``` or equivalent location to your path variable. Learn how to do that [here](http://www.computerhope.com/issues/ch000549.htm).
Look at the other entries for pointers on formatting.
2. Download [Wget for windows](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/wget.htm) and rename the file to wget.exe(notice the lowercase 'w'). Place wget.exe in some directory and add that to the PATH variable as well.
3. In the environment variables, open PATHEXT and add ```;.``` at the end. This means extensionless files will be considered executables.
4. the setup drops a script called 'nwanime-dl' in the ```python27\scripts``` directory. To be able to access and run this script from the command line, run the following commands 
in an elevated command prompt(command prompt in administrator mode)

```
assoc .=Python.File
ftype Python.File=c:\Python27\python.exe "%1" %*
```
5. restart the computer.

###Dependencies:
1. Requests library
2. Beautifulsoup library
3. wget
4. lxml      
These are automatically installed if you use pip.
